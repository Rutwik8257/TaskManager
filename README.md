🟣 Introduction
I’m presenting my project — a Task and Team Management Web Application designed to help admins and team members efficiently manage tasks, track progress, and generate reports."

🟣 Tech Stack
"The app is built using:

Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for UI, Axios for API calls.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js.

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose).

Authentication: JWT tokens for secure role-based access.

Additional tools: ExcelJS for report export, react-hot-toast for notifications."

🟣 Core Features
✅ Authentication

"Users can sign up or log in. Based on their role (admin or user), they see different dashboards. JWT ensures only authorized users can access protected routes."

✅ Dashboard

"The dashboard shows task stats:

Total, pending, in-progress, completed tasks

Task distribution pie chart

Priority bar chart

Recent tasks list"

✅ Task Management

"Admins can:

Create, assign, update, or delete tasks

Assign multiple team members

Users can:

View their tasks filtered by status

Check details, progress, and attachments"

✅ Team Management

"Admins can view team members, their task summary, and download Excel reports of team details."

✅ Reports

"Admins can export task and user reports in Excel format showing detailed task data, assigned users, statuses, and summaries."
